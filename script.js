Have always enjoyed your company and friendship, truly wish it never ends and I hope we have more and more funfilled lives. Sometimes I find you very secretive and challenging friend to have and that intrigues me to the core, it makes me want to know you more and keep up in a good way of course. Regardless, have a fantastic birthday filled with love and laughter! ðŸŽˆ";
